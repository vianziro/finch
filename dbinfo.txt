IS SAVED [DB SAVED TIMELINE] 0 PERTANYAAN  * FROM SAVED TIMELINE WHERE TYPE ='0'
IS SAVED [DB SAVED TIMELINE] 1 JAWABAN  * FROM SAVED TIMELINE WHERE TYPE ='1'
IS SAVED [DB SAVED TIMELINE] 2 BLOG POST   * FROM SAVED TIMELINE WHERE TYPE ='2'

PERTANYAAN 0 WHERE TYPE='0'
JAWABAN 1 WHERE TYPE='1'
POST 2 WHERE TYPE='2'

CHOOSED TOPIC > WHERE TOPIC ='$TOPIC'


POST FROM 
	FILTER CEK users_follow. 
	IF all DELETE FILTER
	IF FRIEND , cek users_follow WHERE followed_username ME
	IF FRIEND, cek user_follow WHERE username = ME


IS SAVED [DB SAVED TIMELINE] 3 BLOG POST   * FROM SAVED TIMELINE WHERE TYPE ='3'


SO WE NEED

SHOW SAVED GET FROM user_bookmark
WHERE show all saved

saring input (WDYW) MAIN CHOOSE

TOPIC input topic

from who , input who.

general filter [from title, viewer, date]

SO TIMELINE TABLE MUST HAVE A TOPIC COLUMN, DATE, VIEWER, TITLE, FROM WHO (COURSE)) AND DONE
